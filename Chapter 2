#histogram: calculate frequency and probability of each value in a dataset 
#the following dictionary can compute frequency
#given a sequence of values: t
hist = {}
for x in t:
    hist[x] = hist.get(x,0) + 1
#the result is a dictionary that maps from values to frequencies

#from frequency to probabilities, we divide the dictionary through n, which is called normalization
n = float(len(t))     #there are n values in T
pmf = {}
for x, freq in hist.items():
   pmf[x] = freq/n
#pmf: a normalized histogram (probability mass function)--a function that maps from values to probabiities
